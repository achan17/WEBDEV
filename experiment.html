        <h1>Developing experiments</h1>
        <p>This section will be where my current experiments with web developing
        and software engineering to be displayed and explored by visitors as well.</p>
        <h2>Web Developing Experiments</h2>

        <h3>Cautionary Code</h3>
        <canvas id="canvas">A teal rectangle.</canvas>
        <div>Notice the difference in background color? While cool, it was
        implemented in the HTML section which violates the <b>Separation of Concerns</b>
        principle. Even this section which to the <i>untrained eye</i> seems 
        fine has some practices which can be <span style="font-size: 28pt;">problematic</span>. Notice the bold and
        italic words, while both styles were used elsewhere in this page, this
        page I used physical tags rather than logical which was used in the other
        pages. Along with those, there are the cautionary advices such as the div
        and span HTML elements I used here which are not inherently bad until you
        use too many of these elements to the point where the page becomes littered
        with divs and spans. However, the biggest issue in this section is at 
        problematic. In here not only did I use a span, but I also combined it with 
        styling to change the font size which violates Separation of concerns. In short,
        if you inspect this div element in your browser, there are numerous practices
        that may be used by others but are advised against. 
        </div>

        <aside>
            <p>If you would like to know more about web developing and the practices
            mentioned such as Separation of Concerns, UCSD's CSE 134B class: Web 
            Client Languages by Professor Powell is a great place to start.

        <h3>Coding in HTML???</h3>
        <p>Throwing it back to when a young and innocent Anthony thought Java
        was coffee and C# was just a music note. Here I am showing off the first
        ever programming activity I did in Java while also showing off how HTML has 
        support for code, just how far the support goes is unknown, but I can't
        wait to test those limits. 
        </p>
        <pre><code>function helloWorld() 
{
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
}</code></pre>

        <h3>A webpage inside of a webpage</h3>
        <iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5" ></iframe>
        <p>Wait a minute, you are trying to learn more about Anthony Chan, not 
        this Persona thing so why is that here? Turns out, there is a 
        feature where developers can display parts of another website on theirs
        if they please, but this can be troublesome because if the webpage is 
        changed or is deleted, then a 404 error could pop up and confuse some
        users thinking something happened.</p>

        <h3>Victory!?!?</h3>
        <figure>
            <figcaption>Take a look at this <strong>WARNING: AUDIO</strong></figcaption>
            <audio controls src="videos/final-fantasy-vii-victory-fanfare-1.mp3"></audio>
        </figure>
        <p>Congratulations! You are victorious in your battle against the play
        button and volume, play the glorious fanfare again to relive the feat.  
        </p>

        <h3>The only acceptable dad joke</h3>

        <p>Ever wanted a chance to write your feelings down and for it to not 
        be saved just so you can let your feelings out but have no trace of it,
        well look no more, I can even provide some philosophical questions to
        help get things going</p>

            <li>What would your younger self think of you now?</li>
            <li>If you could spend a day with anyone, who would it be?</li>

        <p>Now that formula may just seem like a simple font adjustment, but
        Einstein's famous formula was actually done using MathML which allow
        html to write out math formulas and equations, even some of the most
        complicated formulas could be written out with enough patience. Unbe-
        knownst to many, MathML has been a part of the HTML specification for
        a while but developers could not make use of it until recently and that
        is because for about 80 different versions, google chrome did not 
        support the features of MathML meaning for however long the versions
        lasted, Chrome would not make its use available for the browser until
        recently. A little birdie told me that it was not Chrome's development
        team that implemented the MathML support but someone outside of the 
        company who asked to push his implementation onto the main branch and
        google accepted the push.
