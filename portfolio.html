        <h2>Software Creations</h2>

        <summary>San Diego Zoo mimic</summary>
        For my Software Engineering class, we were put into random groups
        and given the task to take all the knowledge we had and were learning
        in the class to put together a prototype mimic of the San Diego Zoo app.

        <h2>Web Creations</h2>
        <details>
        <summary>Slidespace mimic</summary>
        While taking the art of product engineering, I was given a final 
        project of trying to create a copy of slidespace, the website that
        the teaching staff for that course created specifically for that class.
        In there, I had to try and use concepts taught throughout the course
        such as REST principles to set up a website.

        <summary>Resume site</summary>
        The website you are currently on is another web page that I created
        for a class and try to further polish the web development principles 
        that I was taught to create a website that is not only efficient and
        sophisticated, but also accessible to anyone who wishes to visit the
        website.
