                        <p>Hello! I am a 24 year old from Riverside, California. I have a 
                        B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of California, San
                        Diego. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime,
                        YouTube, Twitch, and movies, listening to music, and being active 
                        primarily through weightlifting and sports.</p>

            <h2>Previous Employment</h2>
            <h3>Wang Cho - Busser</h3>
            <p>During the summer between high school and college, I worked a 
            summer job as a busser at a Korean Barbeque restaurant "Wang Cho".
            It was a valuable experience for me as it was my first true dive 
            into the workforce and taught me how to work with peers as well as
            develop my communication skills through occasional conversations
            with customers.</p>

            <h3>Pavement Recycling Systems - Intern Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>In one of my college summer vacation, I worked as an intern for
            the Software Engineering as well as the IT department at Pavement 
            Recycling Systems. From there I was able to get a glimpse into what
            my potential work environment would be and reinforce my passion to 
            pursue a job in the software development field.
